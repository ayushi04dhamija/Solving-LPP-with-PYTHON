    "## WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LINEAR PROGRAMMING?\n",
    "\n",
    "###Linear programming is a mathematical technique for maximizing and minimizing a linear function of several variables,such as output or cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In daily Analytics ,LPP is a approach to come up with the best possible outcome using mathematical model to identify extreme min or max approach to find the linear relationship with the dataset. Which help us optimizing and help finding a feasible point or region for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HOW TO DO LINEAR PROGRAMMING?\n",
    "We will understand LPP by solving the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "A car company produces 2 models, model A and model B. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least 100 model A cars and 80 model B cars each day. Because of limitations on production capacity, no more than 200 model A cars and 170 model B cars can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 200 cars much be shipped each day. If each model A car sold results in a $2000 loss,but each model B car produces a $5000 profit, how many of each type should be made daily to maximize net profits?\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION:\n",
    "x= number of model A car\n",
